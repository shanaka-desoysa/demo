Welcome to Torento Engineering Private Ltd, your trusted source for cutting-edge shoe manufacturing machinery, cutting dies, and accessories. With a legacy that dates back to 1986, we have been the pioneers in Sri Lanka, revolutionizing the industry and setting new standards of excellence.

Our journey began as Torento Engineering Enterprises, a small-scale partnership founded by Deshabimani Srilankathilaka Jeewanasuri Dayantha Hempala De Soysa. Drawing from his personal experience at Ceylon Leather Products Corporation, where imported shoe machinery dominated the market, Mr. De Soysa had a vision to make high-quality, locally manufactured machines accessible to small and medium-scale industries. This led to a paradigm shift in the industry, as we successfully reintroduced Sri Lankan machinery into the market while adhering to international standards.

Responding to the growing demand for precision cutting dies and molds, we established Torento Cutting Dies in 1999. This strategic move allowed us to better serve our customers and provide comprehensive solutions for their shoe manufacturing needs.

In 2004, we reached a significant milestone in our history by merging Torento Engineering Enterprises and Torento Cutting Dies, forming the private liability company known as Torento Engineering Private Ltd. This consolidation enabled us to enhance our capabilities, streamline our operations, and deliver an even higher level of service to our valued clients.

Today, Torento Engineering Private Ltd stands as the unrivaled leader in the Sri Lankan shoe machinery industry. We continue to push boundaries, innovate, and uphold our commitment to delivering cutting-edge solutions that empower our clients to thrive in a rapidly evolving marketplace.
